Add some additional information to customize the knitted document: 
```
date: "`r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`"
output:
  html_document:
    number_sections: yes
    theme: cerulean
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: 5
    toc_float: yes
  pdf_document:
    toc: yes
    toc_depth: '5'
```
This will add a table of contents (toc) and will change the colors (theme: cerulean) 

To find your favorite Rmarkdown theme: https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = 'figures/')
```

```
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE, fig.path='figures/', fig.width=8, fig.height=5 )
```

This saves all figures in the directory `figures` and sets the default figure size

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

Rmarkdown Cheatsheet: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html

"#" hash signs indicate headers.

The number of hashes equals the header level.

## h2

### h3

### h4

placing a single asterisk on either side of a phrase makes it *italic*. 

double asterisks make a word or phrase **bold**.

triple asterisks make a word or phrase bold ***and*** italic. 

* a single asterisk at the beginning of a line makes a bullet 

1. and a number at the begining of a line creates a numbered item. 
1. this should add


When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

Execute this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

## Including Plots & Images

You can also embed plots, for example:

(Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.)

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
```

```{r name, echo=FALSE}
#fhfwgjh
```



`echo =FALSE` will only display the output, not the code.

Some more chunk options: 
* Use `echo=FALSE` to avoid having the code itself shown.
* Use `results="hide"` to avoid having any results printed.
* Use `eval=FALSE` to have the code shown but not evaluated.
* Use `warning=FALSE` and `message=FALSE` to hide any warnings or messages produced.
* Use `fig.height` and `fig.width` to control the size of the figures produced (in inches).


naming chunks = good practice (the above chunk was named pressure)
* helps navigate around the document & this is what the figures will be named

(check the Rproject directory after knitting)

You can also include images from your local computer or from the web:

## Adding tables 

Can type out tables: 

| col name  | 
|---------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------|
| 1        | 1                | 1                |
| 2        | 2                | 2                |


Alternatively, you can use the `knitr` package to make mardown tables from data frames:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(head(cars))
```

*left, right, center adjust* 

## Knitting 
When you knit the file, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Knit* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor (Viewer tab).

# Rprojects 

**Rproject Benefits:**

* No need to set the working directory. All paths are relative to the directory containing the Rproject. 

  Whenever you open your project, the working directory is automatically set to where your project is. This means your code   will not break when you work on a different computer.
  
*  RStudio projects allow you to open multiple projects at the same time with each open to its own project directory. This allows you to keep multiple projects open without them interfering with each other.


Good organization / project lay out will: 

* ensure the integrity of your data
* make it easier to collaborate
* make it easier to a pick a project back up after a break

**Project Management tips:**

* treat raw data as "read only"
* create separate directory for "cleaned data" (or don't save altered data files - will see later on with dplyr) - `results`
* generated output is disposable (because your analysis is reproducible!)
* put scripts in `src` directory 
* name all files to reflect their content or function (e.g. `fig1_pca_communitycomposition.jpg` not `Rplot1.jpg`)
* avoid duplication - as code for a project matures, you will want to start splitting out functions into separate scripts. These scripts might be useful across multiple projects. When reusing a script, use a symbolic link to save space on your computer and avoid having to update a file in multiple places. Data that is reused can also be symbolically linked (`ln -s`) 

**data for this workshop**

following good project management practices, make a new directory called `data` and download the data we will be playing with in this workshop into that directory: 

In terminal tab: 

`mkdir data`

`cd data`

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv`

curl

We will use the data later, but we can get a general sense of the data by looking at it in the terminal, which will help us decide how to load it into R later: 

`wc -l gapminder_data.csv`

`head gapminder_data.csv`

`cd -`

# GitHub 

go to your GitHub account and make a new repository 
DO NOT initialize with a README 

follow the instructions on the next page 

(in terminal tab)
```
echo "# SkillPill_ReproducibleR" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/maggimars/SkillPill_ReproducibleR.git
git push -u origin master
```

`README.md` is a markdown file, just like this Rmarkdown file in many ways- uses similar syntax.

try also adding your data directory to your Github repository!

Alternatively - you can use the Rstudio interface to version control with Git
https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/14-supplemental-rstudio/

(I prefer command line) 

# A few notes on getting help

`?function_name`

If you can't really remember a function name `??function_name`

**pro-tip** *From within the function help page, you can highlight code in the Examples and hit Ctrl+Return to run it in RStudio console. This is gives you a quick way to get a feel for how a function works.*

```{r}
?kable
```

for special operators use quotes, e.g. `?"<-"
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages; `vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for package-name, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.
And then there is always google.  
# Reproducible and Streamlined Analyses (Day 2) 
## Exploring the sample data
We already looked at the sample data in Terminal and saw that it was a `.csv` file with 1705 lines and that it does have a header. 
```{r}
gapminder<- read.csv("data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
```

View data in another tab with `View()`

when your data is in a github repo - you can also use it directly from the repo:

```{r}
library(data.table) # you might need to install this package
gapminder<- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv", header = TRUE)
```

To get more information about the data:

`dim()`

`str()`

`summary()`

`length()`

`nrow()`

`ncol()`

`names()`

head()/tail()

```{r}
```

other types we might see ? 

```{r}
str(factor(gapminder$continent))
ordering_example <- factor(gapminder$continent, levels= c("Oceania", "Asia", "Europe", "Africa", "Americas"))
str(ordering_example)
```
*The wrong structure of the data causes lots of problems*
```{r Structure}
str(gapminder)
```


`as.character()`  - change factors back into characters

`as.numeric()`  - but need to use `as.character()` first

can also set `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` when reading in data

```{r}
(gapminder$continent == "Asia")[c(1:100)]
```



## Subsetting Data Frames

removing rows and columns (subsetting)

by number

```{r}
gapminder[-1,]
```

```{r}
gapminder[,-1]
```

drop multiple rows/columns ...

```{r}
```


drop or select columns by name

```{r}
gapminder[, c("year", "pop", "continent")]
```

```{r}
gapminder[ , -c("year", "pop", "continent")]
```



select rows conditionally 

```{r}
gapminder[country == "Zimbabwe",]
```

```{r}
gapminder[country!= "Afghanistan",]
```


```{r}
gapminder[lifeExp >= 80,]
```

using `&` (and) `|` (or)

```{r}

gapminder[continent == "Asia" & lifeExp >= 80,]

```
```{r}

gapminder[(continent == "Asia" | continent == "Europe") & lifeExp >= 80,]

```

## Control Flow

if, if else, and for 

allows us to control when an action is taken

```
# if
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
}
# if ... else
if (condition is true) {
  perform action
} else {  # that is, if the condition is false,
  perform alternative action
}
```

examples:

```{r}
x <- 9
if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
}

```


```{r}
x <- 8
if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 10")
}
```



```{r}
x <- 8
if (x >= 10) {
  print("x is greater than or equal to 10")
} else if (x > 5) {
  print("x is greater than 5, but less than 10")
} else {
  print("x is less than 5")
}
```

**Challenge:**

Use an if() statement to print a suitable message reporting whether there are any records from 2002 in the `gapminder` dataset:

```{r}

if(sum((gapminder$year == 2002)) >= 1){
  print("There are records from eight years ago")
  
}

#The boolian can also be considere 0 / 1 so if there are any TRUE (2002) values the sum of the boolians will be >=1
```
```{r}
#if the value 2002 is in (%in%) the column year in gapminder then print
if(2002 %in% gapminder$year){
  print("There are records from eight years ago")
  
}
```



Looping 

If you want to iterate over a set of values, when the order of iteration is important, and perform the same operation on each, a `for()` loop will do the job. 

Basic Structure:
```
for (iterator in set of values) {
  do a thing
}
```
Example

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  print(i)
}
```


Nested for loop: 

```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    print(paste(i,j))
  }
}
```


storing results 
```{r}
output_vector <- c()
for (i in 1:5) {
  for (j in c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')) {
    temp_output <- paste(i, j)
    output_vector <- c(output_vector, temp_output)
  }
}
```


**Challenge:** 


Write a script that loops through the `gapminder` data by continent and prints out whether the mean life expectancy is smaller or larger than 50 years.

```{r}
lifelist<-c()

for (i in unique(gapminder$continent)){
  df <- gapminder[continent == i]
  lifelist <- c(lifelist, mean(df$lifeExp))
  
}
data.frame(continent = unique(gapminder$continent), lifeExp = lifelist)

#unique(gapminder$continent)
#setDT(gapminder[seq_along(unique(gapminder$continent)) == 1, mean(lifeExp)]

#I got hung up on trying to make i an integer but i can be the list of unique continent characters themselves!
```


## Functions

reusable! (and therefore reproducible!)

Often start by writing a function within an interactive session. 

Lets write a function that converts Fahrenheit to Celcius (bc I am moving to back to America and I'm going to need this)

```{r}
fahr_to_celc <- function(temp) {
  celc <- ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9))
  return(celc)
}
```


get body temp in celcius: 
(seems to be important these days)

```{r}
fahr_to_celc(98.6)
```

Stopifnot

```{r}
fahr_to_celc <- function(temp) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(temp))
  celc <- ((temp - 32) * (5 / 9))
  return(celc)
}
```

What happens if you call with a number?
```{r}
fahr_to_celc(100)
```

What if you call with a string? 

```{r}
fahr_to_celc("hot")
```


Combining Functions:

Define two functions 

1. fahrenheit to celcius 
2. celcius to kelvin 

Define a new function that calls both these functions to convert fahrenheit to kelvin

```{r}


```


A more useful example: 


Calculate gross domestic product in our data set

```{r}
# Takes a dataset and multiplies the population column
# with the GDP per capita column.
calcGDP <- function(dat) {
  gdp <- dat$pop * dat$gdpPercap
  return(gdp)
}
```


```{r}
calcGDP(head(gapminder))
```

But that is not super useful - lets add more arguments so we can extract per country per year : 

```{r}
# Takes a dataset and multiplies the population column
# with the GDP per capita column.
calcGDP <- function(dat, year=NULL, country=NULL) {
  if(!is.null(year)) {
    dat <- dat[dat$year %in% year, ]
  }
  if (!is.null(country)) {
    dat <- dat[dat$country %in% country,]
  }
  gdp <- dat$pop * dat$gdpPercap
  new <- cbind(dat, gdp=gdp)
  return(new)
}
```

default arguments are NULL


```{r}
head(calcGDP(gapminder, year=2007))
```

```{r}
calcGDP(gapminder, country="Australia")
```


**Challenge:**
Test out your GDP function by calculating the GDP for New Zealand in 1987. How does this differ from New Zealand’s GDP in 1952?

```{r}
```

moving functions to rscripts and sourcing scripts 
(best practices for data management!)
